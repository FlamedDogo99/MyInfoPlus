# MyInfoPlus
A Chrome Extension for Montana State University's MyInfo website to make it look and behave a bit nicer.
To install, download the unpacked extension, enable developer mode in chrome://extensions, and add the extension through "Load Unpacked Extension".
This extension simply adds a stylesheet to all MyInfo pages, and redirects the numerous logout screens to the standard login screen.
